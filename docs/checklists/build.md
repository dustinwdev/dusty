# Dusty Master Build Checklist

Each phase is scoped to complete in a single focused session.
Create per-phase design notes in `docs/design/` as needed.

---

## Phase 1: Workspace & Tooling

- [x] `git init`, `.gitignore`
- [x] Cargo workspace with all crate stubs (lib.rs only)
- [x] `rustfmt.toml`, `clippy.toml` / workspace lint config
- [x] Verify `cargo build --workspace`, `cargo test --workspace`, `cargo clippy --workspace` all pass on empty crates

---

## Phase 2: Signals

Crate: `dusty-reactive`

- [x] `Signal<T>` — create, get, set, update
- [x] `ReadSignal<T>` / `WriteSignal<T>` split access
- [x] Subscriber tracking — signals know their dependents
- [x] Notification — changing a signal notifies subscribers
- [x] `with()` for zero-clone ref access (replaces `SignalGuard`)
- [x] Tests: create, read, write, update closure, multiple subscribers, drop cleanup

---

## Phase 3: Memos & Dependency Tracking

Crate: `dusty-reactive`

- [x] `Memo<T>` — cached derived computation
- [x] Auto-tracking — memo records which signals it reads during evaluation
- [x] Lazy re-evaluation — only recompute when a dependency changed AND value is read
- [x] Diamond dependency handling — memo depending on two signals that share a source
- [x] Tests: basic derivation, caching (doesn't recompute without change), diamond, chained memos

---

## Phase 4: Effects & Scopes

Crate: `dusty-reactive`

- [x] `Effect` — side effect that re-runs when dependencies change
- [x] Auto-tracking for effects (same mechanism as memos)
- [x] `Scope` — arena-based ownership for reactive primitives
- [x] Disposal — dropping a scope cleans up all signals/memos/effects within it
- [x] Nested scopes — child scope disposal doesn't affect parent
- [x] Tests: effect runs on change, effect cleanup, scope disposal, nested scopes

---

## Phase 5: Batching & Resources

Crate: `dusty-reactive`

- [x] `batch()` — coalesce multiple signal writes, notify once
- [x] `Resource<T>` — async data that integrates with signals
- [x] Resource states: loading, ready, error
- [x] Resource re-fetches when source signal changes
- [x] `untrack()` — read a signal without subscribing
- [x] Tests: batch coalesces notifications, resource lifecycle, untrack
